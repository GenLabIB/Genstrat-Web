## ⚙️ Development

### ✏️ Editing Pages

To modify the content of your application, you can begin editing the `app/page.js` file. The page will automatically update as you save your changes. 🔄

### 🔥 Optimizing Fonts

This project uses the [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) feature to automatically load and optimize the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) font, improving performance by loading only the necessary font weights.

---

## ✨ Features

This project leverages the following Next.js features:

- **File-based routing** 📂 – Automatically generates routes based on your `app/` folder structure.
- **Fast Refresh** 🔄 – Hot reloading with automatic page refresh as you modify your components.
- **Image Optimization** 🖼️ – Automatic image optimization for faster loading times.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support** 🎨 – Support for importing CSS/Sass files out of the box.
- **API Routes** 🌐 – Easily create serverless functions inside the `pages/api` directory.
- **Custom Fonts** 🔠 – Easily integrate and optimize custom fonts, such as Google Fonts.
